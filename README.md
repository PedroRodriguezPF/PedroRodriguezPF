# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pedro!  
I'm a data analyst passionate about coding and storytelling through data. I leverage programming languages to clean and process databases, transforming raw information into actionable insights that drive decision-making.

Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in the TripleTen bootcamp. My primary tools are **Python** and **Excel**, which I use to turn complex datasets into clear, compelling visualizations.

- ðŸš€ I love challenges and am always eager to learn new things.
- ðŸ“Š I believe that data and graphics can tell powerful stories.
- ðŸ’¡ I'm a hands-on learner, so I enjoy practicing with real-world datasets to continually improve my skills.

Let's connect and collaborate to turn data into meaningful stories!
